<p><font color="white" size="5">
Non Governmental Organisations, or NGOs, as they 
are called in common parlance, are organisations
which are involved in carrying out a wide range of
activities for the benefit of underprivileged people
and the society at large. As the name suggests, NGOs
work independently, without any financial aid of the
government although they may work in close coordination
with the government agencies for executing their projects.</p>

<p><font color="white" size="5">NGOs are composed of experts with years of experience in executing social welfare activities. 
Before rolling out a project, detailed analysis of the situation is done and possible solutions
are contemplated. Collaboration with civic agencies and other government agencies 
(at district, state and even national level at times) is done to carry out the work.
<p><li><font color="green" size="6"><u> The Importance of NGOs in India</u></li></font></p>
<p>India has made rapid progress in the socio-economic sphere in the last seven decades. 
Millions have been brought out of poverty, life expectancy has shot up, literacy rate 
has almost tripled and people have better access to healthcare services. However, given 
the vastness of India, both in terms of demography and area, and its socio-cultural diversity,
millions are still bereft of a decent life. Even today, numerous people struggle to get
basics such as health, shelter, education and nutritious food. The benefits of Indiaï¿½s economic 
progress have not been uniform in nature. There is rampant economic inequality. This is where
NGOs come into the picture. Their job is to plug the gaps left by the government by
improving the lives of the most marginalised communities.</p>
